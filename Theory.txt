Reinforcement Learning
    Teaching a agent to behave in an enviorment by telling
    it how it's doing


Deep Q Learning

It calculates the Q-function using neural networks, it predicts the expected cumulative reward 
for taking specific actions in a given state

    Repeats these steps
        1. Chooses action (Choose between prediction or random move)
                                A trade off between exploration & exploitation
        2. Performs action
        3. Measure Rewards
        4. Update Q values & train model

    Loss Function is the Bellman Equation (for step 4)

Rewards: Eat food = 10, game_over = -10

Actions:
    - Straight
    - Right turn
    - Left turn

States
    1. Danger Straight
    2. Danger Right
    3. Danger Left

    4. Direction Left
    5. Direction Right
    6. Direction Down
    7. Direction Up

    8. Food Right
    9. Food Left
    10. Food Up
    11. Food Down
