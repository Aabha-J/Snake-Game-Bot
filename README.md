# Overview :snake:
This project implements a classic Snake game using Pygame and trains an AI agent with pytorch using Deep Q Learning to play the game. 
The AI learns to navigate the grid, collect food, and avoid collisions with its own body and the walls.

# Set Up :gear:
1. Clone this repo
2. Create a python virtual enviorment
3. Install dependencies `pip install pytorch numpy pygame`

## Play the Game Yourself :video_game:
  In the terminal: `python snake_game.py`

## Watch the AI Train & Play :robot:
  In the terminal: `python agent.py`
